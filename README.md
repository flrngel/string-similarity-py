# string-similarity-py

Finds degree of similarity between two strings, based on [Dice's Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), which is mostly better than Levenshtein distance.

## Notes

Simple python implementation of [Dice's Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), code is originally from [aceakash/string-similarity](https://github.com/aceakash/string-similarity)
